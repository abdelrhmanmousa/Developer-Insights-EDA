#Developer Insights Analysis

This project uses Stack Overflow survey data to analyze a wide range of insights related to developers worldwide. The analysis focuses on understanding developers' involvement in open-source projects, their earnings, job satisfaction, preferred work environments, and more. Through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, we explore key questions that provide valuable insights into the global developer community.

Key Questions Explored
How many developers are writing code for open-source?

Analyze the extent of developer participation in open-source projects.

How much money do developers earn globally?

Investigate developers' salary distribution across different regions and roles.

How satisfied are developers with their jobs globally?

Explore global job satisfaction among developers and the factors contributing to it.

What is the relation between the age of a developer and their work?

Examine how age correlates with years of coding experience, roles, and technology usage.

What social media sites do developers use?

Identify the most popular social media platforms used by developers for networking and learning.

Which is the most popular operating system among developers?

Discover the preferred operating systems used by developers in their daily work.

Why do most developers update their resumes frequently?

Analyze trends and reasons behind frequent resume updates in the developer community.

What programming languages have developers worked with, and which languages do they want to use in the future?

Identify the most commonly used programming languages and those developers aspire to learn.

Which type of work location is preferred by developers?

Understand the work location preferences (remote, in-office, hybrid) among developers.

Project Workflow
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing Stack Overflow's developer survey responses.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, format strings, and split columns containing multiple values (e.g., DevType and LanguageWorkedWith).

Data Transformation: The data is exploded to handle multiple entries per developer, allowing for better analysis of language distribution by developer type.

Data Analysis: Group and count the languages used by developer type and generate meaningful statistics.

Visualization: Generate charts and graphs to visualize the relationships between developer roles and their choice of programming languages, satisfaction, work locations, and more.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing the data.

Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting and presenting the analysis.
